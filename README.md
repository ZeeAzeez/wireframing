# What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a visual blueprint of a digital productâ€™s layout before actual design and development begin. It focuses on structure, content placement, and user flow rather than colors, images, or final design details.

Importance of Wireframing

Clarifies Layout & Functionality: Helps stakeholders visualize page structure and feature placement early on.

Improves Communication: Ensures designers, developers, and stakeholders share a common understanding.

Saves Time & Costs: Identifies potential usability issues before development, reducing costly changes later.

Supports User-Centered Design: Keeps the focus on user experience (UX) by mapping interactions and navigation clearly.
